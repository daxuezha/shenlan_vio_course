ABSTRACT = {Visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (VI-SLAM) is popular research topic in robotics. Because of its advantages in terms of robustness, VI-SLAM enjoys wide applications in the field of localization and mapping, including in mobile robotics, self-driving cars, unmanned aerial vehicles, and autonomous underwater vehicles. This study provides a comprehensive survey on VI-SLAM. Following a short introduction, this study is the first to review VI-SLAM techniques from filtering-based and optimization-based perspectives. It summarizes state-of-the-art studies over the last 10 years based on the back-end approach, camera type, and sensor fusion type. Key VI-SLAM technologies are also introduced such as feature extraction and tracking, core theory, and loop closure. The performance of representative VI-SLAM methods and famous VI-SLAM datasets are also surveyed. Finally, this study contributes to the comparison of filtering-based and optimization-based methods through experiments. A comparative study of VI-SLAM methods helps understand the differences in their operating principles. Optimization-based methods achieve excellent localization accuracy and lower memory utilization, while filtering-based methods have advantages in terms of computing resources. Furthermore, this study proposes future development trends and research directions for VI-SLAM. It provides a detailed survey of VI-SLAM techniques and can serve as a brief guide to newcomers in the field of SLAM and experienced researchers looking for possible directions for future work.},
